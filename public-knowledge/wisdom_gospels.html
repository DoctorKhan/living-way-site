    <h1>Wisdom Gospels: The Inner Teachings of Yeshua</h1>
    <p style="font-size:1.1rem; color:#5a5a5a; margin-bottom:2.5rem;">This page presents three foundational Wisdom Gospels—The Gospel of Philip, The Gospel of Mary, and The Gospel of Thomas.<br>For each key concept, you will find:<br>1. <b>The Words of Yeshua</b> (reconstructed from the original texts)<br>2. <b>Plain English Meaning</b> (practical philosophy for daily life)</p>
    <hr style="margin:2.5rem 0;">
    <!-- BEGIN GOSPEL CONTENT -->
    <h2 class="gospel-title">1. The Gospel of Philip</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Spiritual Maturity vs. Mere Conversion</h3>
      <blockquote>The Words of Yeshua: "A slave seeks only to be free, but he does not hope to acquire the estate of his master. But the son lays claim to the inheritance of the Father. Do not be as the proselyte who makes another proselyte, like a shadow begetting a shadow. Be you heirs to the Living One, for those who inherit the dead are themselves dead, but those who inherit the Living are alive."</blockquote>
      <div class="plain-english"><b>Plain English Meaning:</b> Joining a religion doesn't change who you are; it just changes what you call yourself. Don't act like a servant begging a distant God for freedom. Realize that you share the same divine nature as God ("the son"), which means you already have spiritual authority and ownership over your own life.</div>
      <h3>Sowing in Winter (The World) to Reap in Summer (Eternity)</h3>
      <blockquote>The Words of Yeshua: "Those who sow in winter shall reap in summer. The world is the winter; the Kingdom is the summer. Sow now in the frost, that ye may feast when the sun rises. For he who seeks to harvest in the winter plucks only barren stalks and will not find the grain."</blockquote>
      <div class="plain-english"><b>Plain English Meaning:</b> Life on earth is hard ("winter") by design. It's meant for work and character building, not for perfect happiness. If you try to find perfect comfort in the material world, you will be disappointed. Do the hard inner work now so that you can enjoy spiritual peace ("summer") later.</div>
      <h3>The Illusion of Dualities and Names</h3>
      <blockquote>The Words of Yeshua: "Light and Darkness, Life and Death, Right and Left—these are brothers one to another. You cannot separate them. The names you speak in the world are deceptive. You say 'God' and 'Father', yet you do not see the Truth. If you were in the Aeon, you would not need names, for you would be the Thing itself."</blockquote>
      <div class="plain-english"><b>Plain English Meaning:</b> Language traps us. We think opposites like Good/Evil or Light/Dark are separate wars, but they are parts of one system. Even religious words like "God" are just symbols, not the real thing. To truly understand reality, you have to stop over-analyzing the words and directly experience the feeling behind them.</div>
      <h3>The Archons (Rulers) and the Trap of Materialism</h3>
      <blockquote>The Words of Yeshua: "The rulers of this age saw that you were kin to the Good, so they took the names of the Good and placed them upon the Evil to deceive you. They desire to take the free man and make him a slave forever. But Truth has come to strip the disguise from the Evil and return the name to the Good."</blockquote>
      <div class="plain-english"><b>Plain English Meaning:</b> Society tricks you. The powers that run the world (media, politics, status) convince you that accumulating stuff and having a big ego is "good." They make slavery to material things look like success. Being spiritual means realizing this is a scam and refusing to play their game.</div>
      <h3>Resurrection Must Happen Now</h3>
      <blockquote>The Words of Yeshua: "Those who say, 'I will die first and then rise,' are in error. If you do not first receive the resurrection while you live, when you die you will receive nothing. Seek the Life while you are in the body, that you may not die."</blockquote>
      <div class="plain-english"><b>Plain English Meaning:</b> Don't wait until you die to go to "heaven" or be "saved." Resurrection is a metaphor for waking up spiritually right now. If you live your whole life asleep (unaware), dying won't magically fix it. You have to become enlightened while you are still in a physical body.</div>
      <h3>The Mystery of the Bridal Chamber (Union)</h3>
      <blockquote>The Words of Yeshua: "The Holy of Holies is the Bridal Chamber. Baptism is a house, redemption is a gate, but the Bridal Chamber is the inner sanctuary. Here, the separation ends. The woman must unite with her husband in the chamber, for those who have united in the chamber will no longer be separated."</blockquote>
      <div class="plain-english"><b>Plain English Meaning:</b> The ultimate goal is "Union." This isn't about sex or marriage; it's about integrating your own psychology. You need to merge your logic (masculine) with your intuition (feminine), and your spirit with your soul. When you stop fighting against yourself, you enter the "Bridal Chamber" of peace.</div>
      <h3>The Mary Magdalene Controversy & The Kiss</h3>
      <blockquote>The Words of Yeshua: "Why do I love her more than you? When a blind man and one who sees are together in darkness, they are the same. But when the light comes, he who sees will see the light, and he who is blind will remain in darkness. It is by a kiss that the perfect conceive and give birth."</blockquote>
      <div class="plain-english"><b>Plain English Meaning:</b> Jesus kissing Mary Magdalene symbolizes the direct transfer of spiritual knowledge (Gnosis). It’s not necessarily a romance; it’s a transmission of wisdom. The other disciples were jealous because they were obsessed with rank and rules, whereas Mary understood that true connection is about spiritual capacity, not social status.</div>
      <h3>God as a "Man-Eater" (Metaphor for Transmutation)</h3>
      <blockquote>The Words of Yeshua: "God is a dyer. As the good dyes dissolve into the things dyed in them, so it is with those whom God has dyed. God is a consumer of men; for this reason, men are sacrificed to Him. Before, animals were sacrificed, but now the living are offered up that they may live."</blockquote>
      <div class="plain-english"><b>Plain English Meaning:</b> This sounds scary, but it means "Ego Death." You can't keep your small, separate identity and also merge with the Universe. To become one with God, your individual ego has to be "eaten" or dissolved. You have to give up your small self to become your big Self.</div>
      <h3>Perception Creates Reality</h3>
      <blockquote>The Words of Yeshua: "It is not possible to see anything of the Truth unless you become like it. You are not as the man who sees the sun but remains a man. You saw the Spirit, you became Spirit. You saw the Father, you shall become Father. In that place, you see yourself, and what you see, you shall become."</blockquote>
      <div class="plain-english"><b>Plain English Meaning:</b> In the physical world, looking at a tree doesn't make you a tree. But in spirituality, you become whatever you focus on. If you focus on anger, you become anger. If you focus on Christ/God, you become that. You can't just study it objectively; you have to embody it.</div>
      <h3>The Root of Evil is Ignorance</h3>
      <blockquote>The Words of Yeshua: "Ignorance is the mother of all evil. While the root of wickedness is hidden, it is strong. But when it is revealed, it dies. Dig down after the root of evil within you and pluck it out of your heart. If you know the truth, the truth will make you free."</blockquote>
      <div class="plain-english"><b>Plain English Meaning:</b> Evil isn't a force attacking you from the outside; it's a result of not knowing yourself. Your "demons" (fear, hate, addiction) only have power because you ignore them or hide them in your subconscious. The only way to stop evil is to stop being ignorant about your own nature.</div>
    </div>

    <h2 class="gospel-title">2. The Gospel of Mary (Magdalene)</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>The Nature of Sin and Matter</h3>
      <blockquote>The Words of Yeshua: "There is no sin. It is you who make sin when you act according to the habits of your corrupted nature. Matter gave birth to a passion that has no image because it proceeds from what is contrary to nature. Peace be with you. Acquire my peace within yourselves."</blockquote>
      <div class="plain-english"><b>Plain English Meaning:</b> Sin isn't about breaking religious rules. It’s simply the pain that comes from acting against your true self or clinging to material things that are temporary. The world is constantly breaking apart and reforming; if you try to hold onto it, you suffer. That suffering is what we call "sin."</div>
      <h3>The Kingdom is Inside (The Son of Man)</h3>
      <blockquote>The Words of Yeshua: "Beware that no one leads you astray, saying 'Lo here!' or 'Lo there!' For the Son of Man is within you. Follow after Him! Those who seek Him will find Him. Go then and preach the gospel of the Kingdom."</blockquote>
      <div class="plain-english"><b>Plain English Meaning:</b> Stop looking for a savior to come from the sky. The "Son of Man" (the perfect human archetype) is already inside you. You have the DNA of the divine within you right now. You don't need to go anywhere; you just need to look inside.</div>
      <h3>Emotional Stability in Crisis</h3>
      <blockquote>The Words of Yeshua (recalled by Mary): "Do not weep and do not grieve nor be irresolute. His Grace will be entirely with you and will protect you. Let us praise His greatness, for He has prepared us and made us into Men."</blockquote>
      <div class="plain-english"><b>Plain English Meaning:</b> When Jesus left, the male disciples panicked. Mary Magdalene stayed calm. This shows that true spiritual maturity is emotional stability. When things go wrong, don't freak out. Remember that you have the inner resources ("Grace") to handle it.</div>
      <h3>Vision Occurs in the Mind (Nous)</h3>
      <blockquote>The Words of Yeshua: "Blessed are you, for you do not waver at the sight of me. For where the mind is, there is the treasure. One does not see through the soul, nor through the spirit, but the Mind that is between the two—that is what sees the vision."</blockquote>
      <div class="plain-english"><b>Plain English Meaning:</b> Spiritual visions aren't just emotional hysteria, nor are they purely intellectual. They happen in the "Nous"—the higher mind or consciousness. It’s a state of "meta-cognition," where you are calm, aware, and watching your own thoughts.</div>
      <h3>The Seven Powers of the Ego (The Ascent)</h3>
      <blockquote>The Words of Yeshua (The Soul's Ascent): "I saw the Soul ascend. To Darkness, it said: 'You deceived me not.' To Craving, it said: 'I see you, but you do not see me.' To Ignorance: 'Why do you judge?' To Wrath: 'I am set loose.' I have recognized the powers, and I pass them by in silence."</blockquote>
      <div class="plain-english"><b>Plain English Meaning:</b> As you grow spiritually, you will have to face your own psychological baggage (Anger, Fear, Lust, etc.). The text calls these "Powers." You can't fight them, but you can transcend them by realizing they are not you. Acknowledge them ("I see you") and then move past them.</div>
      <h3>The Soul's Declaration of Freedom</h3>
      <blockquote>The Words of Yeshua (The Soul's Ascent): "To the Power of Desire, the Soul said: 'I was clothed in a garment, and you knew me not. Now the garment is cast off. I go to my rest in the silence.'"</blockquote>
      <div class="plain-english"><b>Plain English Meaning:</b> This is the moment you realize you are not your body or your personality. Your soul tells your ego, "I was just wearing you like an outfit." The ego didn't even realize the soul was there. True freedom is knowing you are the silent observer, not the loud personality.</div>
      <h3>The Conflict of Gender and Jealousy</h3>
      <blockquote>The Words of Levi (defending the Spirit): "Peter, you have always been hot-tempered. If the Savior made her worthy, who are you to reject her? Surely the Savior knows her very well. That is why He loved her more than us. Rather let us be ashamed and put on the perfect Man."</blockquote>
      <div class="plain-english"><b>Plain English Meaning:</b> Peter gets mad that Jesus taught Mary things he didn't teach the men. This represents the conflict between rigid institutions (Peter) and free-flowing spirit (Mary). Institutions care about who has the title; Spirit cares about who has the wisdom.</div>
      <h3>The Defense of Intuition</h3>
      <blockquote>The Teachings: "The Spirit blows where it wills. Do not judge the vessel, but drink the living water. For the capacity of the heart is greater than the rank of the law."</blockquote>
      <div class="plain-english"><b>Plain English Meaning:</b> Levi tells Peter to shut up and listen. He argues that if Mary understands the truth, then she is worthy, regardless of her gender or status. Capacity trumps rank.</div>
    </div>

    <h2 class="gospel-title">3. The Gospel of Thomas</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>The Burden of Interpretation</h3>
      <blockquote>The Words of Yeshua: "Whoever finds the interpretation of these sayings will not experience death."</blockquote>
      <div class="plain-english"><b>Plain English Meaning:</b> You can't just passively believe these teachings; you have to figure them out yourself. It's a puzzle. If you put in the work to interpret the meaning, you will discover your own immortality.</div>
      <h3>The Emotional Arc of Awakening</h3>
      <blockquote>The Words of Yeshua: "Let him who seeks continue seeking until he finds. When he finds, he will become troubled. When he becomes troubled, he will be astonished, and he will rule over the All."</blockquote>
      <div class="plain-english"><b>Plain English Meaning:</b> Finding the truth is scary at first. It will mess you up because it destroys your comfortable lies. You will feel "troubled." But if you push through that anxiety, you will find "astonishment" and power on the other side.</div>
      <h3>The Kingdom is a State of Consciousness</h3>
      <blockquote>The Words of Yeshua: "If those who lead you say, 'See, the Kingdom is in the sky,' then the birds will precede you. If they say, 'It is in the sea,' then the fish will precede you. Rather, the Kingdom is inside of you, and it is outside of you. When you come to know yourselves, then you will become known."</blockquote>
      <div class="plain-english"><b>Plain English Meaning:</b> God isn't in a specific place (like Heaven). God is a state of consciousness that permeates everything right here, right now. It's inside you and outside you. You just need to notice it.</div>
      <h3>Authenticity is Survival</h3>
      <blockquote>The Words of Yeshua: "If you bring forth what is within you, what you bring forth will save you. If you do not bring forth what is within you, what you do not bring forth will destroy you."</blockquote>
      <div class="plain-english"><b>Plain English Meaning:</b> If you have a talent, a truth, or a purpose inside you, you must express it. If you repress your true self, it will destroy you psychologically. Being authentic saves you; being fake kills you.</div>
      <h3>Non-Duality (Making the Two One)</h3>
      <blockquote>The Words of Yeshua: "When you make the two one, and when you make the inside like the outside and the outside like the inside, and the above like the below... then will you enter the Kingdom."</blockquote>
      <div class="plain-english"><b>Plain English Meaning:</b> Stop living a double life. Stop separating "spiritual" life from "real" life. You need to integrate your inner feelings with your outer actions. When you are the same person on the inside and the outside, you are enlightened.</div>
      <h3>Spiritual Somnambulism (The Drunk World)</h3>
      <blockquote>The Words of Yeshua: "I took my place in the midst of the world, and I appeared to them in flesh. I found them all drunk; I found none of them thirsting. And my soul became afflicted for the sons of men, because they are blind in their hearts and do not see."</blockquote>
      <div class="plain-english"><b>Plain English Meaning:</b> Most people are "drunk" on worldly distractions (money, fame, entertainment). They are asleep at the wheel of their own lives. They are empty inside but don't realize it because they keep distracting themselves.</div>
      <h3>Non-Attachment (The Nomad)</h3>
      <blockquote>The Words of Yeshua: "Be passersby."</blockquote>
      <div class="plain-english"><b>Plain English Meaning:</b> Be a "passerby." Live in the world, but don't get too attached to it. Remember that everything here is temporary. Treat life like a journey, not a permanent destination.</div>
      <h3>The Futility of Ritual without Presence</h3>
      <blockquote>The Words of Yeshua: "Do not tell lies, and do not do what you hate, for all things are plain in the sight of Heaven. For nothing hidden will not become manifest, and nothing covered will remain without being uncovered."</blockquote>
      <div class="plain-english"><b>Plain English Meaning:</b> Rituals like fasting or praying are useless if you are living a lie. The only rule that matters is: Don't lie, and don't do things you hate. Be honest with yourself.</div>
      <h3>Assimilating the Beast (The Lion)</h3>
      <blockquote>The Words of Yeshua: "Blessed is the lion which becomes man when consumed by man; and cursed is the man whom the lion consumes, and the lion becomes man."</blockquote>
      <div class="plain-english"><b>Plain English Meaning:</b> You have animal instincts (sex, aggression, hunger). If you let them control you, you lose your humanity ("the lion eats the man"). If you master them and use that energy for good, you become stronger ("the man eats the lion").</div>
      <h3>Presence Over Prophecy</h3>
      <blockquote>The Words of Yeshua: "The Kingdom of the Father will not come by waiting for it. It will not be a matter of saying 'here it is' or 'there it is.' Rather, the Kingdom of the Father is spread out upon the earth, and men do not see it."</blockquote>
      <div class="plain-english"><b>Plain English Meaning:</b> Stop waiting for the apocalypse or for Jesus to return in the future. The "Kingdom of God" is already here, spread out over the earth. We just don't see it because we are always looking for something else.</div>
