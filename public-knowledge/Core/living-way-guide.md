# ✦ **A Guide to The Way of the Living Jesus**

*(Based on the Gospels of Thomas & Mary)*

## **Chapter 1 — The Outer Child, the Inner Child, and the Path of the Adult**

Human religion, as commonly practiced, begins in **the Outer Child**.
This is not an age but a stage of consciousness—one that learns through:

* imitation,
* obedience,
* belief in authority,
* and vivid imagination.

Because most spiritual traditions are transmitted parent-to-child, they naturally shape themselves around what the undeveloped mind can grasp.

Thus, childhood religion emphasizes:

### **1. External Rules**

Lists of sins and virtues, demands and prohibitions.

### **2. Imaginative Belief**

Literal heavens, literal hells, and a deity imagined as a cosmic parent watching from outside.

### **3. Obedience to Intermediaries**

Priests, texts, and institutions stand between the seeker and the divine.

This system provides moral scaffolding.
But it is **not the Way**.

---

## ✦ The Inner Child

In the Gospel of Thomas and the Gospel of Mary, the “child” has a radically different meaning.

It refers to the **Inner Child**:

* the undivided consciousness,
* open, undefended, whole,
* prior to ego,
* prior to inner/outer,
* the state described in Thomas 22 when Jesus says the child enters the Kingdom easily.

This “child” is not naive.
It is the **original unity of the soul before it clothed itself in division**.

---

## ✦ The Adult on the Way

The Way is not childish religion nor the naive Inner Child.
It is the *maturation* from the Outer Child to the Inner Child, awakening as the **Single One**.

Thus:

* The **Outer Child** believes.
* The **Adult of the Way** knows.
* The **Inner Child** is the consciousness that emerges when division falls away.

The Way, then, is an **adult path**—a passage from borrowed belief to direct, living knowledge.

---

# **Chapter 2 — Who Is the “Living Source”?**

The central mystery of the Way is the nature of the **Living Source**.

Jesus, in Thomas and Mary, speaks not of the tribal god of law and sacrifice, but of:

### ✦ The Living Father —

the Source of Light, the unbegotten Origin.

This Source is:

* eternal,
* formless,
* the origin of the divine spark within you.

Jesus never names or invokes Yahweh.
He speaks of **the One who is Living**, in contrast to the gods of law, judgment, and death.

### ✦ Your Divine Origin

“You are children of the Living Source,” he says (Thomas 3).

This is not moral praise.
It is ontology.
It means:

* You originate in the Light.
* You are a portion of the eternal.
* You wear a temporary garment called “the body.”

### ✦ The Living vs. the Dead

Thomas and Mary use “living” and “dead” symbolically:

* **Living** = Spirit, awareness, unbound consciousness.
* **Dead** = the material self, divided by ignorance and desire.

Jesus is “Living” because he reveals *Life itself* within you.

His purpose is not to die for you
but to **awaken you so you will “not taste death.”**

---

# **Chapter 3 — The Meditative Path of the Way**

The Way is not belief.
It is **inner transformation** through knowledge.

Here are its stages:

---

## ✦ Step 1 — Know Yourself

Jesus begins the Way with a single instruction:

> “When you know yourselves, you will be known,
> and you will understand that you are children of the Living Source.”
> — Thomas 3

### **Practice: Contemplation of the Inner Kingdom**

1. Sit and become aware of your ordinary mind.
   This is the “poverty” Jesus speaks of.

2. Ask: *“Where is the Kingdom?”*
   Reject every external answer.

3. Turn your seeing inward.
   Seek the silent, aware presence behind all experience.

4. Rest in the awareness that perceives all things.
   This is the doorway.

---

## ✦ Step 2 — Make the Two One

The Way is a path of non-duality.

The world of matter appears divided:

* male/female
* inner/outer
* light/dark
* self/other

These divisions are **garments**, not essence.

> “When you make the two one… then you will enter the Kingdom.”
> — Thomas 22

### **Practice: Meditation on Unification**

1. Pick a pair of opposites.
   Breath in / breath out.
   Sound / silence.
   Self / other.

2. Ask: *“What awareness holds both?”*

3. Rest in that awareness.
   This is the **Single One**, the consciousness prior to division.

---

## ✦ Step 3 — Identify the Powers

The Gospel of Mary explains why unity is difficult:
the soul is bound by **Powers**:

* Darkness (ignorance)
* Desire
* Ignorance (confusion)
* Wrath (division and judgment)

“Sin” is not breaking rules.
Sin is **identifying with these powers.**

### **Practice: The Scan of the Powers**

Sit quietly and observe:

* Confusion → “not me”
* Wanting → “not me”
* Anger → “not me”

These are garments, not identity.

The moment you no longer call them “me,”
they loosen.

---

## ✦ Step 4 — The Soul’s Ascent

As Mary describes, the liberated soul proclaims:

> “What bound me has been slain…
> Ignorance has died.”
> — Gospel of Mary

This is not triumphalism.
It is recognition.

### **Practice: Affirmation of the Free Soul**

When a Power arises, say:

* “You did not see me. You did not recognize me.”
* “You are a garment I wore; you are not me.”
* “I was bound, but I have not bound.”
* “I am released from you. I am free.”

This returns you to the **Inner Child**—whole, unbroken, free.

---

# **Chapter 4 — How to Read the Texts**

The Gospel of Thomas and the Gospel of Mary are not history books; they are **technologies of awakening**.

Thomas is a book of **riddles**, while Mary is a **map of the soul's ascent**.

They begin with the promise:

> “Whoever discovers the interpretation of these sayings will not taste death.”
> — Thomas 1

This means:

* The sayings are mirrors.
* Their meaning is not literal.
* Their truth is found only in inward transformation.

### Examples:

* “The lion” is the untamed ego.
* “The poor” are those who do not know themselves.
* “The child” is the undivided Self.

Read the sayings as **maps of your consciousness**, not history or doctrine.

---

# **Chapter 5 — Paul and the Birth of a New Religion**

The Living Jesus teaches **inner awakening**.

Paul teaches **belief in an external event**.

The two paths are not the same.

Paul never met Jesus in life.
His theology comes from a vision interpreted through Jewish sacrifice and Roman concepts of authority.

Thus the great inversion:

| The Way (Jesus)                  | The New Theology (Paul)                 |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Know yourself                    | Believe certain doctrines               |
| Inner awakening                  | External salvation through Jesus’ death |
| Sin = ignorance                  | Sin = legal guilt                       |
| Salvation = understanding origin | Salvation = accepting atonement         |
| Body = garment to transcend      | Body = temple awaiting resurrection     |
| Authority = inner experience     | Authority = apostles and institutions   |
| (Mary 4:5)                       | (Galatians 1:12)                        |

Paul turned the Way’s **self-liberation**
into a religion of **vicarious redemption**.

---

# **Chapter 6 — The Inversion of Symbols**

As Christianity merged with empire, it replaced the Way’s internal path with external ritual.

### ✦ The Cross

In Thomas and Mary, the cross has no saving role.
Salvation is from **knowledge**, not **death**.

The later Church centered salvation on:

* Jesus’ suffering,
* blood sacrifice,
* an external historical event.

This reversed the Way’s inward focus.

### ✦ Pagan Symbolism

When Rome adopted Christianity, it:

* replaced the Way with imperial religion,
* adopted the cross from solar cults,
* mapped Jesus’ birth to **Sol Invictus** (the "Unconquered Sun") and **Saturnalia**,
* and turned the inner "Soul's Ascent" into yearly festivals like **Easter** (named after the goddess **Ēostre**).

**The Lost Symbols of Life:**
For the first 300 years, followers of the Way did not use the cross. They used symbols of life:
* The **Ichthys** (Fish)
* The **Chi-Rho** (☧)
* The **Good Shepherd**

The cross—a Roman instrument of torture—was only adopted later by Emperor Constantine as a symbol of imperial victory.

### ✦ The Constructed Savior: The Pagan Blueprint

Paul and the early church didn't just adopt holidays; they adopted the *story* of the pagan mystery gods to construct the theological Jesus. The "Living Jesus" of Thomas is a teacher of wisdom. The "Christ" of Paul is a syncretic deity modeled on the dying-and-rising gods of the Mediterranean.

To create a religion that would appeal to the Gentile world, the Jewish teacher was overlaid with the myths of:

*   **Mithras:** A Persian savior-god popular with Roman soldiers. He was associated with light, born of a rock (or virgin in some traditions), had 12 companions, and his followers shared a sacramental meal of bread and wine.
*   **Dionysus:** The Greek god of wine. He was the "Son of God" (Zeus) and a mortal woman, performed miracles (turning water to wine), and was associated with death and rebirth.
*   **Osiris/Horus:** The Egyptian archetype of the resurrected god who conquers death to become the judge of the dead.
*   **Attis:** A Phrygian god born of a virgin, who died under a tree and rose again after three days.

By using these mythic templates, Paul created a figure that the Roman world could recognize and worship—not as a guide to inner light, but as a new, superior version of their old gods.

### ✦ Temples and Priests

The Way requires no building and no priest.
Mary, not Peter, exemplifies the true disciple—one who sees inwardly.

Rome built:

* basilicas,
* a priestly hierarchy,
* and intermediaries between God and the individual.

These re-created the “poverty” Jesus came to end.

---

# ✦ **Conclusion — The Return to the Inner Child**

The Way of the Living Jesus is neither the obedience of the Outer Child
nor the theology of Paul’s religion.

It is the return to the **Inner Child**,
the one who is:

* whole,
* undivided,
* born of the Light,
* and already living in the Kingdom spread upon the earth.

The Way is not belief.
It is remembering.

It is not worship.
It is awakening.

It is not waiting.
It is seeing.

> The Kingdom is within you and without you.
> When you come to know yourselves,
> you will realize that you are children of the Living Source.
