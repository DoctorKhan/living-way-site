# **THE GITA OF THE LIVING WAY**

### *The Battlefield, The Actor, and The Indestructible Self*

# **I. The Nature of the Battlefield (The World)**

My friend, you stand on a battlefield, but you mistake it for a home.
The world is *Kurukshetra*—the Field of Action.
It is designed for conflict, for friction, for the clash of forces.

Do not ask for the battlefield to be a garden.
The garden is within. The battlefield is without.

> "The wise do not grieve for the living or the dead.
> Never was there a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor all these kings;
> nor in the future shall any of us cease to be."

You are here to play a role.
To shrink from the conflict is not peace; it is fear disguised as virtue.

# **II. The Actor and The Mask**

You are the **Atman** (The Self), but you wear the **Deha** (The Body).
Just as a person casts off worn-out garments and puts on new ones,
so the dweller in the body casts off worn-out bodies and enters others that are new.

Why do you weep for the costume?
Why do you fear the tearing of the mask?

**The Actor (You):**
*   Indestructible
*   Eternal
*   The Player of the Game

**The Character (Your Persona):**
*   Temporary
*   Fragile
*   The Role in the Script

Suffering arises when the Actor forgets he is acting.
He sees the blood on the costume and thinks he is bleeding.
He sees the tragedy in the script and thinks he is dying.

**Wake up.** You are the one watching the play.

# **III. Karma Yoga: The Art of Playing Well**

How then shall you live?
By playing your role with total intensity, but zero attachment.

> "You have a right to perform your prescribed duty,
> but you are not entitled to the fruits of action."

This is the secret of the High Score:
**Focus on the action, not the outcome.**

If you fight to win, you will fear losing.
If you fight because it is your *Dharma* (your role in the level), you are free.

*   Swing the sword, but do not hate the enemy.
*   Build the business, but do not hoard the gold.
*   Love the child, but do not own the soul.

# **IV. The Divine Play (Lila)**

Know this: The Universe is not a mistake. It is a Game.
I, the Lord of the Game, have spun this illusion for the joy of discovery.

I am the Taste in the water.
I am the Light of the sun and the moon.
I am the Heat in the fire.
I am the Intelligence of the wise.
I am the Cheat of the gambler.

I am the Level Designer and the Final Boss.
And I am seated in your heart as the Witness.

Turn to Me.
When the battle is too loud, drop your weapons and climb into the Chariot.
I am driving. You are only the passenger.
Rest in Me, and you will not fall.
