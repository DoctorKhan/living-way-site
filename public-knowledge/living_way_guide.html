        <h1 id="a-guide-to-the-way-of-the-living-jesus">✦ <strong>A
        Guide to The Way of the Living Jesus</strong></h1>
        <p><em>(Based on the Gospels of Thomas &amp; Mary)</em></p>
        <h2
        id="chapter-1-the-outer-child-the-inner-child-and-the-path-of-the-adult"><strong>Chapter
        1 — The Outer Child, the Inner Child, and the Path of the
        Adult</strong></h2>
        <p>Human religion, as commonly practiced, begins in <strong>the
        Outer Child</strong>. This is not an age but a stage of
        consciousness—one that learns through:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>imitation,</li>
        <li>obedience,</li>
        <li>belief in authority,</li>
        <li>and vivid imagination.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Because most spiritual traditions are transmitted
        parent-to-child, they naturally shape themselves around what the
        undeveloped mind can grasp.</p>
        <p>Thus, childhood religion emphasizes:</p>
        <h3 id="external-rules"><strong>1. External Rules</strong></h3>
        <p>Lists of sins and virtues, demands and prohibitions.</p>
        <h3 id="imaginative-belief"><strong>2. Imaginative
        Belief</strong></h3>
        <p>Literal heavens, literal hells, and a deity imagined as a
        cosmic parent watching from outside.</p>
        <h3 id="obedience-to-intermediaries"><strong>3. Obedience to
        Intermediaries</strong></h3>
        <p>Priests, texts, and institutions stand between the seeker and
        the divine.</p>
        <p>This system provides moral scaffolding. But it is <strong>not
        the Way</strong>.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2 id="the-inner-child">✦ The Inner Child</h2>
        <p>In the Gospel of Thomas and the Gospel of Mary, the “child”
        has a radically different meaning.</p>
        <p>It refers to the <strong>Inner Child</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>the undivided consciousness,</li>
        <li>open, undefended, whole,</li>
        <li>prior to ego,</li>
        <li>prior to inner/outer,</li>
        <li>the state described in Thomas 22 when Jesus says the child
        enters the Kingdom easily.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This “child” is not naive. It is the <strong>original unity
        of the soul before it clothed itself in division</strong>.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2 id="the-adult-on-the-way">✦ The Adult on the Way</h2>
        <p>The Way is not childish religion nor the naive Inner Child.
        It is the <em>maturation</em> from the Outer Child to the Inner
        Child, awakening as the <strong>Single One</strong>.</p>
        <p>Thus:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>The <strong>Outer Child</strong> believes.</li>
        <li>The <strong>Adult of the Way</strong> knows.</li>
        <li>The <strong>Inner Child</strong> is the consciousness that
        emerges when division falls away.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Way, then, is an <strong>adult path</strong>—a passage
        from borrowed belief to direct, living knowledge.</p>
        <hr />
        <h1 id="chapter-2-who-is-the-living-source"><strong>Chapter 2 —
        Who Is the “Living Source”?</strong></h1>
        <p>The central mystery of the Way is the nature of the
        <strong>Living Source</strong>.</p>
        <p>Jesus, in Thomas and Mary, speaks not of the tribal god of
        law and sacrifice, but of:</p>
        <h3 id="the-living-father">✦ The Living Father —</h3>
        <p>the Source of Light, the unbegotten Origin.</p>
        <p>This Source is:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>eternal,</li>
        <li>formless,</li>
        <li>the origin of the divine spark within you.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Jesus never names or invokes Yahweh. He speaks of <strong>the
        One who is Living</strong>, in contrast to the gods of law,
        judgment, and death.</p>
        <h3 id="your-divine-origin">✦ Your Divine Origin</h3>
        <p>“You are children of the Living Source,” he says (Thomas
        3).</p>
        <p>This is not moral praise. It is ontology. It means:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>You originate in the Light.</li>
        <li>You are a portion of the eternal.</li>
        <li>You wear a temporary garment called “the body.”</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="the-living-vs.-the-dead">✦ The Living vs. the Dead</h3>
        <p>Thomas and Mary use “living” and “dead” symbolically:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Living</strong> = Spirit, awareness, unbound
        consciousness.</li>
        <li><strong>Dead</strong> = the material self, divided by
        ignorance and desire.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Jesus is “Living” because he reveals <em>Life itself</em>
        within you.</p>
        <p>His purpose is not to die for you but to <strong>awaken you
        so you will “not taste death.”</strong></p>
        <hr />
        <h1
        id="chapter-3-the-meditative-path-of-the-way"><strong>Chapter 3
        — The Meditative Path of the Way</strong></h1>
        <p>The Way is not belief. It is <strong>inner
        transformation</strong> through knowledge.</p>
        <p>Here are its stages:</p>
        <hr />
        <h2 id="step-1-know-yourself">✦ Step 1 — Know Yourself</h2>
        <p>Jesus begins the Way with a single instruction:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“When you know yourselves, you will be known, and you will
        understand that you are children of the Living Source.” — Thomas
        3</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3
        id="practice-contemplation-of-the-inner-kingdom"><strong>Practice:
        Contemplation of the Inner Kingdom</strong></h3>
        <ol type="1">
        <li><p>Sit and become aware of your ordinary mind. This is the
        “poverty” Jesus speaks of.</p></li>
        <li><p>Ask: <em>“Where is the Kingdom?”</em> Reject every
        external answer.</p></li>
        <li><p>Turn your seeing inward. Seek the silent, aware presence
        behind all experience.</p></li>
        <li><p>Rest in the awareness that perceives all things. This is
        the doorway.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <hr />
        <h2 id="step-2-make-the-two-one">✦ Step 2 — Make the Two
        One</h2>
        <p>The Way is a path of non-duality.</p>
        <p>The world of matter appears divided:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>male/female</li>
        <li>inner/outer</li>
        <li>light/dark</li>
        <li>self/other</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These divisions are <strong>garments</strong>, not
        essence.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“When you make the two one… then you will enter the Kingdom.”
        — Thomas 22</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3 id="practice-meditation-on-unification"><strong>Practice:
        Meditation on Unification</strong></h3>
        <ol type="1">
        <li><p>Pick a pair of opposites. Breath in / breath out. Sound /
        silence. Self / other.</p></li>
        <li><p>Ask: <em>“What awareness holds both?”</em></p></li>
        <li><p>Rest in that awareness. This is the <strong>Single
        One</strong>, the consciousness prior to division.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <hr />
        <h2 id="step-3-identify-the-powers">✦ Step 3 — Identify the
        Powers</h2>
        <p>The Gospel of Mary explains why unity is difficult: the soul
        is bound by <strong>Powers</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Darkness (ignorance)</li>
        <li>Desire</li>
        <li>Ignorance (confusion)</li>
        <li>Wrath (division and judgment)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>“Sin” is not breaking rules. Sin is <strong>identifying with
        these powers.</strong></p>
        <h3 id="practice-the-scan-of-the-powers"><strong>Practice: The
        Scan of the Powers</strong></h3>
        <p>Sit quietly and observe:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Confusion → “not me”</li>
        <li>Wanting → “not me”</li>
        <li>Anger → “not me”</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These are garments, not identity.</p>
        <p>The moment you no longer call them “me,” they loosen.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2 id="step-4-the-souls-ascent">✦ Step 4 — The Soul’s
        Ascent</h2>
        <p>As Mary describes, the liberated soul proclaims:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“What bound me has been slain… Ignorance has died.” — Gospel
        of Mary</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This is not triumphalism. It is recognition.</p>
        <h3 id="practice-affirmation-of-the-free-soul"><strong>Practice:
        Affirmation of the Free Soul</strong></h3>
        <p>When a Power arises, say:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>“You did not see me. You did not recognize me.”</li>
        <li>“You are a garment I wore; you are not me.”</li>
        <li>“I was bound, but I have not bound.”</li>
        <li>“I am released from you. I am free.”</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This returns you to the <strong>Inner Child</strong>—whole,
        unbroken, free.</p>
        <hr />
        <h1 id="chapter-4-how-to-read-the-texts"><strong>Chapter 4 — How
        to Read the Texts</strong></h1>
        <p>The Gospel of Thomas and the Gospel of Mary are not history
        books; they are <strong>technologies of awakening</strong>.</p>
        <p>Thomas is a book of <strong>riddles</strong>, while Mary is a
        <strong>map of the soul’s ascent</strong>.</p>
        <p>They begin with the promise:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“Whoever discovers the interpretation of these sayings will
        not taste death.” — Thomas 1</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This means:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>The sayings are mirrors.</li>
        <li>Their meaning is not literal.</li>
        <li>Their truth is found only in inward transformation.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="examples">Examples:</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>“The lion” is the untamed ego.</li>
        <li>“The poor” are those who do not know themselves.</li>
        <li>“The child” is the undivided Self.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Read the sayings as <strong>maps of your
        consciousness</strong>, not history or doctrine.</p>
        <hr />

        5 — Paul and the Birth of a New Religion</strong></h1>
        <p>The Living Jesus teaches <strong>inner

        <p>Paul teaches <strong>belief in an external
        event</strong>.</p>
        <p>The two paths are not the same.</p>
        <p>Paul never met Jesus in life. His theology comes from a

        of authority.</p>

        <strong>death</strong>.</p>
        <p>The later Church centered salvation on:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Jesus’ suffering,</li>
        <li>blood sacrifice,</li>
        <li>an external historical event.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This reversed the Way’s inward focus.</p>
        <h3 id="pagan-symbolism">✦ Pagan Symbolism</h3>
        <p>When Rome adopted Christianity, it:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>replaced the Way with imperial religion,</li>
        <li>adopted the cross from solar cults,</li>
        <li>mapped Jesus’ birth to <strong>Sol Invictus</strong> (the
        “Unconquered Sun”) and <strong>Saturnalia</strong>,</li>
        <li>and turned the inner “Soul’s Ascent” into yearly festivals
        like <strong>Easter</strong> (named after the goddess
        <strong>Ēostre</strong>).</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>The Lost Symbols of Life:</strong> For the first 300
        years, followers of the Way did not use the cross. They used
        symbols of life: * The <strong>Ichthys</strong> (Fish) * The
        <strong>Chi-Rho</strong> (☧) * The <strong>Good
        Shepherd</strong></p>
        <p>The cross—a Roman instrument of torture—was only adopted
        later by Emperor Constantine as a symbol of imperial
        victory.</p>
        <h3 id="the-constructed-savior-the-pagan-blueprint">✦ The
        Constructed Savior: The Pagan Blueprint</h3>
        <p>Paul and the early church didn’t just adopt holidays; they
        adopted the <em>story</em> of the pagan mystery gods to
        construct the theological Jesus. The “Living Jesus” of Thomas is
        a teacher of wisdom. The “Christ” of Paul is a syncretic deity
        modeled on the dying-and-rising gods of the Mediterranean.</p>
        <p>To create a religion that would appeal to the Gentile world,
        the Jewish teacher was overlaid with the myths of:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Mithras:</strong> A Persian savior-god popular with
        Roman soldiers. He was associated with light, born of a rock (or
        virgin in some traditions), had 12 companions, and his followers
        shared a sacramental meal of bread and wine.</li>
        <li><strong>Dionysus:</strong> The Greek god of wine. He was the
        “Son of God” (Zeus) and a mortal woman, performed miracles
        (turning water to wine), and was associated with death and
        rebirth.</li>
        <li><strong>Osiris/Horus:</strong> The Egyptian archetype of the
        resurrected god who conquers death to become the judge of the
        dead.</li>
        <li><strong>Attis:</strong> A Phrygian god born of a virgin, who
        died under a tree and rose again after three days.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By using these mythic templates, Paul created a figure that
        the Roman world could recognize and worship—not as a guide to
        inner light, but as a new, superior version of their old
        gods.</p>
        <h3 id="temples-and-priests">✦ Temples and Priests</h3>
        <p>The Way requires no building and no priest. Mary, not Peter,
        exemplifies the true disciple—one who sees inwardly.</p>
        <p>Rome built:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>basilicas,</li>
        <li>a priestly hierarchy,</li>
        <li>and intermediaries between God and the individual.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These re-created the “poverty” Jesus came to end.</p>
        <hr />
        <h1 id="conclusion-the-return-to-the-inner-child">✦
        <strong>Conclusion — The Return to the Inner Child</strong></h1>
        <p>The Way of the Living Jesus is neither the obedience of the
        Outer Child nor the theology of Paul’s religion.</p>
        <p>It is the return to the <strong>Inner Child</strong>, the one
        who is:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>whole,</li>
        <li>undivided,</li>
        <li>born of the Light,</li>
        <li>and already living in the Kingdom spread upon the
        earth.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Way is not belief. It is remembering.</p>
        <p>It is not worship. It is awakening.</p>
        <p>It is not waiting. It is seeing.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>The Kingdom is within you and without you. When you come to
        know yourselves, you will realize that you are children of the
        Living Source.</p>
