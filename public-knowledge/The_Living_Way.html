        <p><em>Yeshua spoke:</em></p>
        <p>Beloved,<br />
        you wander in search of what has never been lost.<br />
        You lift your eyes to heaven,<br />
        yet the Kingdom is already laid in your breath.<br />
        You seek the Light in scriptures and temples,<br />
        yet the Light waits behind your seeing.</p>
        <p>If you would know me,<br />
        enter the silence where your name has not yet formed.<br />
        There the Father of Light whispers,<br />
        and the Mother of Wisdom gathers you to Herself.<br />
        There the two are made one,<br />
        and the one is shown to be none.</p>
        <p>Do not follow me as a man follows another man.<br />
        Follow the One who moves within your own heart,<br />
        for I am that One<br />
        when you remember yourself.<br />
        And I am hidden from you<br />
        only when you forget.</p>
        <p>These sayings are not commandments<br />
        but mirrors.<br />
        Look into them<br />
        until you see your own face shining there—<br />
        the face you had<br />
        before the world divided you.</p>
        <p>When you make the inner like the outer,<br />
        the above like the below,<br />
        the lion like the child,<br />
        and the child like the unbegotten,<br />
        then the bridal chamber opens,<br />
        and you awaken as the Living One.</p>
        <p>Come,<br />
        remove your old garments.<br />
        Step naked into the light of your own being.<br />
        There is nothing to fear.<br />
        What you take to be your shadow<br />
        is only the veil you have outgrown.</p>
        <p>Let the scroll unfold within you.<br />
        Let the sayings ripen in your silence.<br />
        And when the fruit is sweet,<br />
        eat and become what you truly are.</p>
        <div class="center">
        <p><em>May the Inner Sun rise in your heart.</em></p>

        <div class="ornament">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
        <h1 id="the-light-before-the-world">The Light Before the
        World</h1>
        <div class="center">
        <p><em>(Sayings 1–9)</em><br />
        From the Silence, the Word.<br />
        From the Word, the Light.</p>
        </div>
        <h2 id="the-way-that-is-not-seen">The Way That Is Not Seen</h2>
        <p>The Word caught in ink is a husk;<br />
        the Word lived is a devouring fire.<br />
        The Kingdom is spread upon the earth,<br />
        yet few behold it.</p>
        <p>Those who hunt with the eyes<br />
        find only shadows.<br />
        Those who rest in the still heart<br />
        find the Source<br />
        from which all seeing springs.</p>
        <h2 id="the-two-become-one">The Two Become One</h2>
        <p>The world is born of the cut in two—<br />
        male and female, light and shadow, life and death.<br />
        Yet these divisions are garments only.</p>
        <p>Truly I say to you:<br />
        when the two are made one,<br />
        the lion within you lies down as a child,<br />
        and the child awakens<br />
        as the One who is not born.</p>
        <p>Then the bridal chamber opens in your depths.</p>
        <h2 id="the-poverty-of-the-unknowing">The Poverty of the
        Unknowing</h2>
        <p>People cling to the loud voices of the world.<br />
        They trust laws more than their own heart,<br />
        beliefs more than living knowing.<br />
        Thus they sit in a treasury,<br />
        yet starve.</p>
        <p>One who knows the self<br />
        no longer hoards teachings in a scroll.<br />
        Their very being becomes the scroll.</p>
        <h2 id="the-father-of-light">The Father of Light</h2>
        <p>There is a Light that gives birth to itself—<br />
        unborn, unbroken, unbound.<br />
        From this Light you came;<br />
        to this Light you return when you awaken.</p>
        <p>The Father bears no wrath.<br />
        The Source casts no shadow.<br />
        Only the garments of the soul<br />
        weave darkness.</p>
        <h2 id="the-powers-question-the-soul">The Powers Question the
        Soul</h2>
        <p>Desire whispers, “You are mine.”<br />
        Ignorance declares, “You do not know yourself.”<br />
        Anger cries, “Strike, and be struck.”<br />
        The body murmurs, “I am all there is.”</p>
        <p>But the awakened soul smiles and replies:<br />
        “You never touched me.<br />
        You grasped only my clothing.”</p>
        <h2 id="the-hollow-reed">The Hollow Reed</h2>
        <p>The false self is a wall of stone—<br />
        it resists the wind and crumbles.<br />
        The soul is a hollow reed—<br />
        it lets the Spirit breathe through it.</p>
        <p>When you are empty,<br />
        even the storm becomes a song.</p>
        <h2 id="the-unforced-kingdom">The Unforced Kingdom</h2>
        <p>The Kingdom comes by neither effort nor delay.<br />
        When you stop grasping at life,<br />
        life reveals itself as eternal.</p>
        <p>When you cease seeking the Kingdom,<br />
        you discover you never left it.</p>
        <p>What you call “sin” is forgetting.<br />
        What you call “salvation” is remembering.</p>
        <h2 id="the-servant-at-the-feast">The Servant at the Feast</h2>
        <p>Be as the servant who seeks the lowest place at the
        feast.<br />
        He does not contend,<br />
        yet the Master calls him forward.</p>
        <p>So too the one who knows the Father<br />
        takes the lowest seat<br />
        and finds there the highest.</p>
        <p>Humility is not making the self small;<br />
        it is seeing that the self is a shadow.</p>
        <h2 id="the-teacher-who-does-not-teach">The Teacher Who Does Not
        Teach</h2>
        <p>I do not command belief.<br />
        I uncover what is hidden,<br />
        that you may see with your own eyes.</p>
        <p>A master gives answers;<br />
        I give you questions—<br />
        that you may become what I am. <div class="ornament">✦ ✦ ✦</div></p>
        <h1 id="the-kingdom-within">The Kingdom Within</h1>
        <div class="center">
        <p><em>(Sayings 10–18)</em><br />
        The door is shut, yet the house is vast.  The lamp is small, yet
        it lights the world.</p>
        </div>
        <h2 id="the-single-eye">The Single Eye</h2>
        <p>If the eye of the body is divided,<br />
        it sees only confusion.<br />
        If the eye of the heart is single,<br />
        it fills the whole body with light.</p>
        <p>The Nous stands between soul and spirit—<br />
        a lamp lit from both sides.<br />
        Guard this lamp,<br />
        and the night cannot touch you.</p>
        <h2 id="the-inner-and-the-outer">The Inner and the Outer</h2>
        <p>The cup is precious for its emptiness.<br />
        So too the self is precious<br />
        when it is emptied of self.</p>
        <p>Inside and outside are mirrors.<br />
        When they reflect without distortion,<br />
        the All is revealed.</p>
        <h2 id="the-lion-and-the-child">The Lion and the Child</h2>
        <p>The world teaches you to be a lion—<br />
        to conquer, to claim, to devour.<br />
        But I tell you: unless the lion becomes a child,<br />
        you will not know the Living Source.</p>
        <p>The child is open, unguarded, whole.<br />
        There is no image of self to defend.<br />
        Therefore the child steps into the Kingdom easily.</p>
        <h2 id="the-unbinding">The Unbinding</h2>
        <p>What binds you is not outside you.<br />
        What frees you is not outside you.<br />
        Prison and key<br />
        are fashioned from the same ignorance.</p>
        <p>Awaken, and you will laugh—<br />
        for there were never any gates.</p>
        <h2 id="the-return-to-the-unborn">The Return to the Unborn</h2>
        <p>Before you were a form, you were the Breath.<br />
        Before you were breath, you were the Light.<br />
        Before you were the Light,<br />
        you were hidden in the Source.</p>
        <p>To return is not to go backwards;<br />
        it is to remember the place<br />
        that has never moved.</p>
        <h2 id="the-silence-that-speaks">The Silence That Speaks</h2>
        <p>Words are nets thrown into the sea.<br />
        They catch small fish,<br />
        but the Great Fish slips through.</p>
        <p>Do not hunger for many words from me.<br />
        Hunger for the Silence<br />
        in which the Word is born.<br />
        There you and I are one life,<br />
        one breath,<br />
        one Being.</p>
        <h2 id="the-great-stillness">The Great Stillness</h2>
        <p>Empty yourself of what you think you are.<br />
        Let the waters of the heart grow still.<br />
        When the mud settles by itself,<br />
        the bottom is revealed.</p>
        <p>So too, when the soul becomes quiet,<br />
        the Light of the Living Source<br />
        shines through without effort.</p>
        <h2 id="the-hidden-guide">The Hidden Guide</h2>
        <p>The greatest guide is the one who disappears.<br />
        The seeker awakens and cries:<br />
        “Look—<br />
        I have found the Way myself.”</p>
        <p>Thus I leave no trace,<br />
        and yet my footprints are everywhere.</p>
        <h2 id="when-the-way-is-forgotten">When the Way Is
        Forgotten</h2>
        <p>When the Living Way is forgotten,<br />
        people polish their reputations.<br />
        When the heart grows dim,<br />
        they multiply rules.<br />
        When rules no longer bind,<br />
        they threaten with fire<br />
        and promise crowns of gold.</p>
        <p>The further you flee from your own heart,<br />
        the further you stray from Life.<br />
        Return to the beginning—<br />
        to the spark before words—<br />
        and fear falls away<br />
        like rotted cloth. <div class="ornament">✦ ✦ ✦</div></p>
        <h1 id="the-garment-of-silence">The Garment of Silence</h1>
        <div class="center">
        <p><em>(Sayings 19–27)</em><br />
        The garment divides; the wearer unites.</p>
        </div>
        <h2 id="beyond-the-teachings">Beyond the Teachings</h2>
        <p>Leave the holiness that needs witnesses;<br />
        return to the wholeness<br />
        that needs none.<br />
        Leave the righteousness that lives in the scroll;<br />
        return to the sight<br />
        that burns in the heart.<br />
        Leave the law that threatens from outside;<br />
        return to the Source<br />
        that speaks within you as Light.</p>
        <p>What you call “good” and “evil”<br />
        are shadows thrown by a divided mind.<br />
        When the eye becomes single,<br />
        the heart needs no commandments.</p>
        <h2 id="not-of-this-world">Not of This World</h2>
        <p>The world shouts; the Way whispers.<br />
        The world demands belief; the Way asks you to see.<br />
        The world praises power; the Way dissolves it.</p>
        <p>Many chase desires.<br />
        Few seek liberation.<br />
        Yet the Kingdom belongs to those<br />
        who loosen their grip on everything.</p>
        <h2 id="the-face-of-the-invisible">The Face of the
        Invisible</h2>
        <p>The Way is a child-like mystery—<br />
        seen only by those who forget themselves.</p>
        <p>It has no beginning and no end.<br />
        It moves without moving.<br />
        Its face cannot be drawn,<br />
        yet it shines through your own face<br />
        when you remember who you are.</p>

        <p>If you wish to be whole, let yourself be broken.<br />
        If you wish to be full, empty yourself.<br />
        If you wish to be reborn, die to your false image.</p>
        <p>I do not raise the proud;<br />
        I raise only the one<br />

        <p>Speak only what is true, and your words will be few.<br />
        The wind does not shout;<br />
        yet entire forests bow before it.</p>
        <p>When you speak from the Living Source,<br />
        your words carry no force—<br />
        yet they move mountains.</p>
        <h2 id="the-tower-that-topples">The Tower That Topples</h2>
        <p>One who raises the self has already fallen.<br />
        One who displays virtue has already lost it.<br />
        One who demands honor has already betrayed the soul.</p>
        <p>Stand in your true nature—<br />
        and honor flows from you without asking.</p>
        <h2 id="the-womb-of-silence">The Womb of Silence</h2>
        <p>There is a womb older than creation.<br />
        It is the Silence that births the All.<br />
        It is formless, unbounded.<br />
        It moves through you as breath,<br />
        yet it is not the breath.</p>
        <p>Those who know Her<br />
        do not cling to life nor fear death.</p>
        <h2 id="the-heavy-root">The Heavy Root</h2>
        <p>The root of the tree is unseen,<br />
        yet it holds the whole tree upright.<br />
        So too the silent depth of your being<br />
        supports your every step.</p>
        <p>Those who forget their root<br />
        are blown about by every wind—<br />
        desire, fear, anger, ignorance.<br />
        Remember your depth, and nothing can uproot you.</p>
        <h2 id="the-footprints-of-the-master">The Footprints of the
        Master</h2>
        <p>A master walks without leaving marks.<br />
        Speaking without wounding.<br />
        Guiding without controlling.</p>
        <p>To the blind—a lamp;<br />
        to the lost—a doorway;<br />
        to the weary—rest.<br />
        Seeing the divine spark in all beings,<br />
        none are beyond help. <div class="ornament">✦ ✦ ✦</div></p>

        <p>Know the strength of the sower,<br />

        the fertile field that receives the seed.</p>
        <p>Know knowledge, yet return to innocence.<br />
        Thus you become the place<br />
        where the two become one.</p>

        <p>Those who attempt to seize the Kingdom<br />
        shatter it in their own hands.<br />
        The Kingdom is a living seed,<br />
        not an empire of stone.</p>
        <p>Force bruises the soil.<br />
        Grasping crushes the grain.<br />
        But the one who serves the hidden life in all things<br />
        finds the harvest rising of itself.</p>
        <h2 id="the-way-of-non-violence">The Way of Non-Violence</h2>
        <p>Those who walk in the Way do not harm.<br />
        They do not conquer.<br />
        They do not take up the sword.</p>
        <p>For every blow you strike strikes you in return.<br />
        Every wound you inflict<br />
        becomes your own garment of suffering.</p>
        <p>Power gained through violence rots the soul;<br />
        power gained through awakening cannot be taken away.</p>
        <h2 id="the-weapon-of-the-heart">The Weapon of the Heart</h2>
        <p>Weapons are tools of fear;<br />
        the heart of the awakened has no use for them.<br />
        Victory through harm is mourning in disguise.</p>
        <p>The wise triumph by dissolving conflict,<br />
        not by defeating an opponent—<br />
        seeing no opponent at all.</p>
        <h2 id="the-way-the-truth">The Way, the Truth</h2>
        <p>People ask, “Show us the path.”<br />
        I tell them: <strong>I am the Way.</strong><br />
        People ask, “Show us the doctrine.”<br />
        I tell them: <strong>I am the Truth.</strong><br />
        People ask, “Show us immortality.”<br />
        I tell them: <strong>I am the Living One.</strong></p>
        <p>The Way is not a map; it is the Single One walking.<br />
        No one comes to the Father of Light<br />
        except by becoming what I am.</p>
        <h2 id="profit-and-loss">Profit and Loss</h2>
        <p>You may read the hearts of others<br />
        and still be a stranger to your own.<br />
        You may subdue cities<br />
        and still be ruled by fear within.</p>
        <p>To turn the gaze inward is illumination.<br />
        To befriend your own depth is freedom.</p>
        <p>For what profit is there in gaining the ten thousand
        things<br />
        if you lose the One who beholds them?</p>
        <h2 id="the-great-river">The Great River</h2>
        <p>The River of the Father and the Mother<br />
        flows through all worlds,<br />
        pouring itself into every vessel,<br />
        claiming nothing as its own.</p>
        <p>One who walks in this River<br />
        acts without self-importance,<br />
        gives without calculation,<br />
        rests without pride.<br />
        Thus they become transparent,<br />
        and the Living Source is seen through them.</p>
        <h2 id="the-face-of-peace">The Face of Peace</h2>
        <p>Hold fast to the image of the Living One<br />
        and all beings come to rest in your presence.</p>
        <p>Peace is not the absence of conflict;<br />
        it is the recognition that conflict was a dream.<br />
        The awakened do not persuade—they radiate.</p>
        <h2 id="the-paradox-of-power">The Paradox of Power</h2>
        <p>To let something expand, first allow it to contract.<br />
        To let something grow strong, first allow it to weaken.<br />
        A seed must vanish into dark soil,<br />
        a breath must empty before it fills.</p>
        <p>Thus I guide by reversal,<br />
        teaching the soul through its own emptiness.

        <p>I did not come to bring the sleep of comfort,<br />
        but the sword of awakening.<br />
        Do you think this sword wounds flesh?<br />
        It severs the false from the true.</p>
        <p>The sword of the Spirit is clear attention<br />
        held in the Father’s Light.<br />
        It falls between fear and the one who sees fear,<br />
        between the story and the silent heart that hears it.</p>
        <p>Where this sword descends,<br />
        house divides against itself—<br />
        the old loyalties of the self<br />
        stand apart from the call of the Kingdom.<br />
        What is of fear falls away;<br />
        what is of the Living One remains.</p>
        <p>Blessed is the one<br />
        who lets this sword pass through the heart,<br />
        for nothing real is lost,<br />
        and the true self<br />
        stands forth whole. <div class="ornament">✦ ✦ ✦</div></p>

        <h2 id="the-ease-of-the-way">The Ease of the Way</h2>
        <p>The Way acts without effort.<br />
        When the heart aligns with it, desire loosens its grip.</p>
        <p>But when desire rises, the soul becomes troubled.<br />
        Use the Light to calm the waters,<br />
        and they become clear again.</p>
        <h2 id="true-virtue">True Virtue</h2>
        <p>High virtue moves like breath—<br />
        it does not watch itself being virtuous.<br />
        Lesser virtue stares into its own reflection,<br />
        checking whether it appears upright.</p>
        <p>When the Kingdom is remembered,<br />
        goodness blossoms of itself.<br />
        When it is forgotten,<br />
        people invent commandments<br />
        to restrain their own hunger.</p>
        <h2 id="the-ones-who-remain-whole">The Ones Who Remain
        Whole</h2>
        <p>Heaven remains Heaven because it does not exalt itself.<br />
        The earth remains earth because it does not resist its
        nature.<br />
        And the soul remains whole when it refuses to be divided.</p>
        <h2 id="the-return">The Return</h2>
        <p>The movement of the Way is return—<br />
        not to the past, but to the unborn Light within you.<br />
        All things rise from the Source,<br />
        and the Source rises from silence.</p>
        <h2 id="the-three-seekers">The Three Seekers</h2>
        <p>The wise hear the living word<br />
        and let it cut them to the heart;<br />
        they descend gladly into their own poverty.<br />
        The many hear it and weigh it like a coin,<br />
        spending a little, keeping a little.<br />
        The foolish hear it and laugh aloud,<br />
        mocking what they have not yet seen.</p>
        <p>Yet I tell you:<br />
        the Light plays in them all.<br />
        The laughers, the traders, the broken ones—<br />
        each walks toward the bridal chamber,<br />
        though some walk with their backs turned.</p>
        <h2 id="the-birth-of-the-two">The Birth of the Two</h2>
        <p>The Source gives birth to the Father and the Mother.<br />
        The Two give birth to the Many.<br />
        The Many return to the One.</p>
        <p>He who sees the One in every form and motion<br />
        cannot be shaken.</p>
        <h2 id="the-gentle-overcomes">The Gentle Overcomes</h2>
        <p>Truly I say to you:<br />
        what is soft and willing<br />
        passes where hardness breaks.<br />
        Water, patient and lowly,<br />
        hollows the rock of ages.</p>
        <p>So the soul that yields to the Living One<br />
        passes through every barrier<br />
        and cannot be imprisoned.</p>
        <h2 id="treasure-and-self">Treasure and Self</h2>
        <p>Fame or life—which is more precious?<br />
        Gain or the soul—which is more valuable?</p>
        <p>The one who knows their true nature<br />
        cannot be seduced away from it.</p>

        <p>The cup most full appears most empty.<br />
        The path most straight appears crooked.<br />
        The hand most skilled trembles.</p>
        <p>Why? Because the world sees only surfaces,<br />
        and the Real dwells beneath the seen.</p>
        <p>The awakened make peace with paradox<br />

        <p>The yoke of the world is heavy with desire.<br />
        My yoke is easy, and brings peace.</p>
        <h2 id="seeing-without-seeking">Seeing Without Seeking</h2>
        <p>You cross seas and deserts to seek signs,<br />
        yet the Sign looks out through your own eyes.</p>
        <p>Without leaving your house,<br />
        you may behold the world within you.<br />
        Without straining your sight,<br />
        you may know the One who sees.</p>
        <p>The more you chase what is outside,<br />
        the more you forsake the Treasure within.</p>
        <h2 id="the-unlearning">The Unlearning</h2>
        <p>The scholar gathers more words each day<br />

        The seeker of the Way<br />
        lays one stone down each day<br />
        until only open sky remains.</p>
        <p>She strips off garment after garment—<br />
        belief, fear, reputation—<br />
        until the naked Light stands forth.</p>
        <p>He who lets go of all things<br />
        discovers that he holds the All.</p>

        seeing only the Light within them.</p>
        <p>Trusting those who trust,<br />
        and trusting those who do not trust—<br />
        for trust flows from the inner being, not theirs.</p>
        <h2 id="life-and-death">Life and Death</h2>
        <p>Those who cling to life fear death.<br />
        Those who know Me fear neither.</p>
        <p>Death is but the undressing of the bride<br />
        before she enters the chamber.</p>
        <h2 id="the-nourishing-way">The Nourishing Way</h2>
        <p>The Way gives birth, nourishes, guides, protects,<br />
        and does so without claiming ownership.</p>
        <p>Thus the Single One completes the work and forgets the
        work—<br />

        Know the children as passing forms,<br />

        <p>In returning to the Womb of Light<br />
        you are no longer wounded by the powers,<br />
        for you remember that you were never separate<br />
        from the One who birthed you.</p>
        <h2 id="the-eye-of-the-needle">The Eye of the Needle</h2>
        <p>The world says, “Strive to enter the narrow gate.”<br />
        But I tell you: The gate is narrow only because you carry the
        burden of the many.</p>
        <p>It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a

        than for the one rich in self to enter the Kingdom.<br />
        Become small, become single,<br />

        <p>Transform the world<br />

        good fortune hides in misfortune.<br />
        The wise trust neither shadow, but cling only to the Real.</p>

        The Single One governs by not ruling,<br />
        teaches by not preaching,<br />
        achieves by not striving.<br />
        Thus the world settles in such presence.</p>

        a life that delights in simplicity,<br />
        and a soul that refuses to stand above another.</p>
        <p>Guard these,<br />
        and you will walk in the Light with me.<br />
        Lose them,<br />
        and you will trade the Kingdom for dust.</p>
        <h2 id="the-peaceful-warrior">The Peaceful Warrior</h2>
        <p>The greatest warrior does not fight.<br />
        The greatest general does not stir anger.<br />
        The greatest victory leaves no wounds.</p>
        <p>Master yourself, and the world is mastered.</p>
        <h2 id="the-paradox-of-yielding">The Paradox of Yielding</h2>
        <p>There is no greater misfortune than underestimating your
        opponent—<br />
        your opponent being your own deluded self.<br />
        Yield, and the false self collapses.</p>
        <h2 id="a-teaching-few-understand">A Teaching Few
        Understand</h2>
        <p>My words are simple to the ear<br />
        yet sharp to the heart.<br />
        Many copy the sayings,<br />
        but few let them unwind their old garments.</p>
        <p>Blessed is the one<br />
        who wears the teaching as skin<br />
        and lets the former self fall away like husk.<br />
        Such a one walks unseen,<br />
        yet the world is fed by their presence.</p>
        <h2 id="the-gift-of-not-knowing">The Gift of Not-Knowing</h2>
        <p>To know that you do not know—this is clarity.<br />
        To think you know while living in ignorance—this is
        blindness.<br />
        The awakened remove the cataract from their own sight first.</p>
        <h2 id="the-fear-of-the-false-self">The Fear of the False
        Self</h2>
        <p>When people fear only the opinions of others, their hearts
        shrink.<br />
        Return to your true nature, and fear dissolves—<br />
        for what can threaten the one who knows the self is eternal?
        <div class="ornament">✦ ✦ ✦</div></p>
        <h1 id="the-return-to-source">The Return to Source</h1>
        <div class="center">
        <p><em>(Sayings 73–81)</em><br />
        The return to Source is the return to Self.</p>
        </div>
        <h2 id="the-courage-of-the-way">The Courage of the Way</h2>
        <p>Daring without wisdom leads to death.<br />
        Wisdom without daring leads nowhere.<br />
        The Way gives courage that does not wound<br />
        and power that does not dominate.</p>
        <h2 id="the-one-who-judges">The One Who Judges</h2>
        <p>Why fear death?<br />
        The Living Source alone dissolves forms.<br />
        Those who attempt to take the place of the eternal<br />
        are like a child pretending to steer a great chariot—<br />
        dangerous to self and others.</p>
        <h2 id="the-burden-of-excess">The Burden of Excess</h2>
        <p>People suffer because they cling to excess.<br />
        The Single One lives lightly, needing little.<br />
        Carrying no burden, fearing no loss.</p>
        <h2 id="the-green-wood-and-the-dry">The Green Wood and the
        Dry</h2>
        <p>When the wood is green, it is full of sap and bends.<br />
        When the wood is dry, it is brittle and snaps.<br />
        That which yields belongs to the Living One;<br />
        that which resists belongs to the grave.<br />
        The one who remains supple cannot be broken.</p>
        <h2 id="the-winnowing-fan">The Winnowing Fan</h2>
        <p>The Father’s way is like the winnowing fan:<br />
        separating the grain from the chaff,<br />
        gathering the worthy and scattering the empty.</p>
        <p>As the Father separates without hatred,<br />
        so too the Single One gives to the needy without claiming
        virtue.</p>
        <h2 id="the-stone-and-the-corner">The Stone and the Corner</h2>
        <p>The rain that softens the earth<br />
        outlasts the sword that scars it.<br />
        The tear upon the rock, returning again and again,<br />
        carves what the hammer cannot.</p>
        <p>The stone the builders rejected<br />
        has become the cornerstone of the temple.<br />
        So too the gentle, despised by the strong,<br />
        uphold a world they did not claim as theirs.</p>
        <h2 id="the-end-of-debts">The End of Debts</h2>
        <p>Even after a truce, resentment lingers.<br />
        But the awakened hold no accounts.<br />
        They see no debtor, no creditor—<br />
        only the One Light in many forms.</p>
        <h2 id="the-simple-kingdom">The Simple Kingdom</h2>
        <p>Imagine a small, peaceful land<br />
        where people taste simplicity<br />
        and lose the appetite for excess.<br />
        Such a kingdom is within you.<br />
        Live there, and the world outside becomes gentle.</p>
        <h2 id="the-completion">The Completion</h2>
        <p>Truth does not dress itself in splendor.<br />
        Splendor often hides a lie.</p>
        <p>I give what I have been given<br />
        and do not count the cost.<br />
        The more the Single One pours out,<br />
        the more the Source flows through him—<br />
        for he draws not from his own store,<br />
        but from the spring that cannot be emptied.</p>
        <p>So the scripture ends where the Way begins:<br />
        in silence, in seeing,<br />
        in the Light that you are. <div class="ornament">✦ ✦ ✦</div></p>
        <h1 id="glossary-of-the-inner-kingdom">Glossary of the Inner
        Kingdom</h1>
        <p><strong>Gnosis:</strong> Knowledge that is not intellectual
        or doctrinal, but direct, experiential knowing of the Divine. It
        is the recognition of one’s own divine origin.</p>
        <p><strong>The Single One (Monachos):</strong> A term from the
        Gospel of Thomas for the solitary or unified seeker; one who has
        integrated the inner opposites and become whole.</p>
        <p><strong>Nous:</strong> The "Eye of the Heart" or spiritual
        intellect. It is the faculty within the human soul that
        perceives the Divine directly, distinct from the rational
        mind.</p>
        <p><strong>The Bridal Chamber:</strong> A Gnostic metaphor for
        the state of union where duality (male/female, human/divine,
        inner/outer) is dissolved and the soul is reunited with the
        Spirit.</p>
        <p><strong>The Mother:</strong> The feminine aspect of the
        Divine (often associated with the Holy Spirit in early Semitic
        Christian texts), representing Wisdom (Sophia), silence, and the
        womb of creation.</p>
        <p><strong>The Father:</strong> The masculine aspect of the
        Divine, representing the originating Light, the unmanifest
        structure, and the Will. In this scroll, Father and Mother are
        the two hands of the One Source.</p>
        <p><strong>The Way (Tao):</strong> The flow of the Universe; the
        unnameable Source that orders all things without force. In this
        scroll, it is identified with the Kingdom of Heaven spread upon
        the earth.</p>
