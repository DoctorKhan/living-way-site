# The Eternal Way of the Unforced Leader

## (道德經)

### Chapter 1

道可道，非恆道。  
Ways that can be spoken are not eternal ways.

名可名，非恆名。
Categories we can define are not eternal categories.

無名，萬物之始；  
Without categorification, it precedes the world of forms,  
residing within the eternal unseen.

有名，萬物之母。  
With categorification, it spans the world of forms,  
encompassing all things seen.

恆有欲，以觀其徼；  
Within desire, you observe the shape,  
the limits becoming clear.

故恆無欲，以觀其妙。  
Without desire, you observe the subtle workings,  
the currents becoming clear.

異名同謂。  
Both of these are differently classified, yet point to one way.

兩者同出，
For both of these have the same origin.

玄之又玄。
A mystery within a mystery

眾妙之門。  
and the gateway to all mysteries.

### Chapter 2

天下皆知美之為美，  
When beauty is named,

斯惡已。
its shadow appears

皆知善
When goodness is praised,

斯不善矣。 
another is rejected as bad

有無之相生也，  
Being and non-being create each other

難易之相成也，  
Difficult and easy shape each other.

長短之相刑也，  
Long and short measure each other.

高下之相盈也，  
High and low balance each other.

音聖之相和也，  
Tone and sound weave each other into harmony.

先後之相隨也。  
Before and after walk in sequence.

是以聖人居無為之事，  
Therefore, the Sage dwells in non-action, before the creation of opposites

行不言之教；  
and teaches without imposing words.

萬物作焉而不辭，  
The ten thousand things arise, and the Sage does not turn away.

生而不有，  
Brings forth, but does not possess.

為而不恃，  
Acts, but does not depend on status or claim.

功成而弗居。  
Accomplishes, but does not dwell on accomplishment.

夫唯弗居，是以不去。  
Because the Sage does not dwell on it, it does not leave.
