# **I. The Twin Verses (Mind is the Forerunner)**

Mind precedes all things.
Mind is their chief; they are all mind-made.
If you speak or act with a clouded mind,
suffering follows you like the wheel follows the ox.

Mind precedes all things.
Mind is their chief; they are all mind-made.
If you speak or act with a clear mind,
happiness follows you like a shadow that never leaves.

"He abused me, he struck me, he defeated me, he robbed me."
In those who harbor such thoughts, hatred will never cease.

"He abused me, he struck me, he defeated me, he robbed me."
In those who do not harbor such thoughts, hatred will cease.

For hatred does not cease by hatred at any time:
hatred ceases by love. This is an eternal law.

# **II. Vigilance (The Awake)**

Vigilance is the path to the deathless.
Negligence is the path to death.
The vigilant do not die;
The negligent are as if already dead.

Just as a fletcher straightens an arrow,
so the wise man straightens his trembling, unsteady mind,
which is difficult to guard and difficult to control.

Like a fish taken from its watery home and thrown on dry ground,
our thought trembles all over in order to escape the dominion of Mara (illusion).

# **III. The Flowers (The Body)**

Knowing that this body is like foam,
and comprehending that it is as unsubstantial as a mirage,
one should break the flower-tipped arrows of Mara,
and go where the King of Death cannot see.

As the bee collects nectar and flies away without damaging the flower or its color or scent,
so let a sage dwell in his village.

Do not look at the faults of others,
or what others have done or not done;
observe only what you yourself have done or not done.

# **IV. The Fool and The Wise**

Long is the night to him who is awake;
long is a mile to him who is tired;
long is life to the foolish who do not know the true law.

"These sons belong to me, this wealth belongs to me."
With such thoughts a fool is tormented.
He himself does not belong to himself;
how much less sons and wealth?

If a traveler does not meet with one who is his better, or his equal,
let him firmly keep to his solitary journey;
there is no companionship with a fool.

# **V. The Thousands (Better than Words)**

Better than a thousand hollow words
is one word that brings peace.

Better than a thousand verses
is one verse that brings peace.

If a man were to conquer in battle a thousand times a thousand men,
and another conquer one, himself,
he indeed is the greatest of conquerors.

# **VI. The Way (The Path)**

You yourself must strive.
The Buddhas only point the way.
Those who enter the path and practice meditation
are released from the bonds of Mara.

"All created things perish."
He who knows and sees this becomes passive in pain;
this is the way to purity.

"All created things are sorrow and pain."
He who knows and sees this becomes passive in pain;
this is the way that leads to purity.

"All forms are unreal."
He who knows and sees this becomes passive in pain;
this is the way that leads to purity.

# **VII. The Brahmin (The True Sage)**

I do not call a man a Brahmin because of his origin or of his mother.
He is indeed arrogant if he is wealthy.
But the poor who is free from attachments, him I call indeed a Brahmin.

Him I call indeed a Brahmin who, though he has committed no offense,
endures reproach, bonds, and stripes,
who has endurance for his force, and strength for his army.

Him I call indeed a Brahmin who is free from anger, dutiful, virtuous,
without appetite, who is subdued, and has received his last body.

Him I call indeed a Brahmin who does not cling to pleasures,
like water on a lotus leaf, like a mustard seed on the point of a needle.

# **VIII. The Final Instruction**

Make an island unto yourself.
Strive hard; be wise.
Blow away the impurities and be free from stain;
and you will enter into the heavenly world of the elect.

By degrees, little by little, from time to time,
a wise man should remove his own impurities,
as a smith removes the dross from silver.
