# The Unified Field Papers of the Living Way

## I. The Optical Delusion of Consciousness
A human being is a part of the whole called by us universe, a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feeling as something separated from the rest, a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.

## II. The Cosmic Religion
The most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious. It is the fundamental emotion that stands at the cradle of true art and true science. Whoever does not know it and can no longer wonder, no longer marvel, is as good as dead, and his eyes are dimmed. It was the experience of mystery -- even if mixed with fear -- that engendered religion. A knowledge of the existence of something we cannot penetrate, our perceptions of the profoundest reason and the most radiant beauty, which only in their most primitive forms are accessible to our minds: it is this knowledge and this emotion that constitute true religiosity. In this sense, and only this sense, I am a deeply religious man.

## III. The Living Way as Law
The Living Way is not a moral code imposed by a capricious judge. It is the underlying geometry of the universe. Just as mass curves space-time, so does Love curve the fabric of human destiny. To live in the Way is to align oneself with the laws of spiritual physics. To resist the Way is to fight against gravity itself—exhausting and futile.

## IV. Time is a Stubborn Illusion
People like us, who believe in physics, know that the distinction between past, present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion. The Living Way exists in the Eternal Now. Anxiety is living in a future that does not exist; regret is living in a past that is dead. The only reality is this moment, where the observer and the observed become one.

## V. The Intuitive Mind
The intuitive mind is a sacred gift and the rational mind is a faithful servant. We have created a society that honors the servant and has forgotten the gift. The Living Way restores the gift to its rightful place. Logic can take you from A to B. Imagination—and the Spirit—can take you everywhere.

## VI. Spinoza's God
I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with the fates and actions of human beings. The Living Way is that Harmony. To walk it is to be in tune with the orchestra of the cosmos.
